This section describes the _Vector Heat Method_ in geometry-central, which computes parallel transport of vectors using heat flow, and applications that follow from it.

Note that these quantities all depend on the _intrinsic_ geometry of a surface (via the `IntrinsicGeometryInterface`). Therefore, these routines can be run on abstract geometric domains as well as traditional surfaces in 3D.

These algorithms are described in [The Vector Heat Method](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/VectorHeatMethod/paper.pdf). 

`#include "geometrycentral/surface/vector_heat_method.h"`

For the polygon mesh version, see the [polygon mesh heat solver](/surface/algorithms/polygon_heat_solver); for point clouds, see the [point cloud heat solver](/pointcloud/algorithms/heat_solver/).

## Vector Heat Solver

The stateful class `VectorHeatSolver` shares precomputation for all of the routines below.

??? func "`#!cpp VectorHeatSolver::VectorHeatSolver(IntrinsicGeometryInterface& geom, double tCoef=1.0)`"

    Create a new solver for the Vector Heat Method. Precomputation is performed lazily as needed.

    - `geom` is the geometry (and hence mesh) on which to compute. Note that nearly any geometry object (`VertexPositionGeometry`, etc) can be passed here.

    - `tCoef` is the time to use for short time heat flow, as a factor `m * h^2`, where `h` is the mean edge length. The default value of `1.0` is almost always sufficient.

    Algorithm options (like `tCoef`) cannot be changed after construction; create a new solver object with the new settings.


## Scalar Extension

Given scalar data defined at isolated source locations on a surface, extend it to the entire domain. Each point on the domain will take the value of the nearest source point.  Note that the fast diffusion algorithm means the result is a slightly smoothed-out field.

Example:
```cpp
// your mesh and geometry
VertexPositionGeometry geometry;
SurfaceMesh mesh;

// construct a solver
VectorHeatMethodSolver vhmSolver(geometry);

// some interesting source values
std::vector<std::tuple<Vertex, double>> points;
for (/* ... some inputs ... */ ) {
  Vertex sourceVert = /* something */;
  double sourceVal = /* something */;
  points.emplace_back(sourceVert, sourceVal);
}

// solve!
VertexData<double> scalarExtension = vhmSolver->extendScalar(points);
```

??? func "`#!cpp VertexData<double> VectorHeatSolver::extendScalar( const std::vector<std::tuple<Vertex, double>>& sources)`"

    Compute the nearest-neighbor extension of scalar data defined at isolated vertices to the entire domain.  The input is a list of vertices and their corresponding values.

??? func "`#!cpp VertexData<double> VectorHeatSolver::extendScalar( const std::vector<std::tuple<SurfacePoint, double>>& sources)`"

    Compute the nearest-neighbor extension of scalar data defined at isolated points to the entire domain.  The input is a list of [surface points](../../utilities/surface_point/) and their corresponding values.


## Vector Extension

![bean vector extension](/media/bean_vector.jpg)

Given tangent vectors defined at one or more isolated source locations on a surface, extend transport the vectors across the entire domain according to parallel transport. Each point on the domain will take the value of the nearest source point.  Note that the fast diffusion algorithm means the result is a slightly smoothed-out field.

??? func "`#!cpp VertexData<Vector2> VectorHeatSolver::transportTangentVectors(Vertex sourceVert, Vector2 sourceVec)`"
    
    Compute the parallel transport of a vector defined at a single vertex to the entire domain. The input is defined in the tangent space of the source vertex.

??? func "`#!cpp VertexData<Vector2> VectorHeatSolver::transportTangentVectors( const std::vector<std::tuple<Vertex, Vector2>>& sources)`"
    
    Compute the parallel transport of vectors defined at a collection of vertices to the entire domain. The input is defined in the tangent space of each the source vertex.

??? func "`#!cpp VertexData<Vector2> VectorHeatSolver::transportTangentVectors( const std::vector<std::tuple<SurfacePoint, Vector2>>& sources)`"

    Compute the parallel transport of vectors defined at a collection of [surface points](../../utilities/surface_point/) to the entire domain. The input is defined in the tangent space of each the vertex, face, or edge respectively.

## Logarithmic Map

The _logarithmic map_ is a very special 2D local parameterization of a surface about a point, where for each point on the surface the magnitude of the log map gives the geodesic distance from the source, and the polar coordinate of the log map gives the direction at which a geodesic must leave the source to arrive at the point.

![octopus logmap](/media/octopus_logmap.jpg){: style="height:300px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"}

These routines compute the logarithmic map using the vector heat method.

??? func "`#!cpp VertexData<Vector2> VectorHeatSolver::computeLogMap(const Vertex& sourceVert)`"

    Compute the logarithmic map with respect to the given source vertex.

    The angular coordinate of the log map will be respect to the tangent space of the source vertex.


??? func "`#!cpp VertexData<Vector2> VectorHeatSolver::computeLogMap(const SurfacePoint& sourceP)`"

    Compute the logarithmic map with respect to the given source point, which is a general [surface point](../../utilities/surface_point/).

    The angular coordinate of the log map will be respect to the tangent space of the source vertex, edge, or face.
